This project organizes plans to create a low-cost camper total conversion from a small hatchback vehicle. An important requirement is that no permanent damage can be made to the vehicle in achieving all desired amenities and technologies, including:

* (shower) Hot shower mechanism
* (recorder) Constant Video & Audio recording w/ position & timestamp
* (reporter) Video processing and persistant sync to cloud
* (viewer) Google maps powered realtime tracker enabling examination of video, audio, positions, and timestamps
* (sleeper) Sleeping quarters
* (privacy) Privacy augmentations, such as interior window shrouds, etc 

I will add to the above list as additional needs become apparent. Each item is to be designed in its own folder designated by its codename.
